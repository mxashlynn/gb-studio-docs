# Plugins

Plugins are a way to extend GB Studio and share reusable assets, create custom scripting events and even build engine modifications.

## Installing Plugins

To use plugins you must first create a `plugins` folder within your project in the same folder as your `.gbsproj` file. You can then place any plugins you have within this folder.

The structure should look something like this: 

<img src="/img/screenshots/plugins-file-structure.png" className="event-preview" />

You may need to close and reopen your project after adding plugins for the changes to appear.

## Asset Plugins

The simplest kind of plugin you can make for GB Studio is an asset plugin, these allow you to share sprites, backgrounds, fonts, sounds, anything that is normally placed in the `assets` folder.

To create an asset plugin first create a new folder within your `plugins` folder with the name you want to give your plugin (Above we used `assetPlugin` as the name). Within that folder you can create any of the normal project `asset` folders (such as `backgrounds`) and place files within it. These assets will appear as normal in your project but are now easier to package up and share between projects or with others.

## Script Event Plugins

These plugins allow you to create new script events that will appear anywhere you use [Scripting Events](/docs/scripting).

To create a script event plugin first create a new folder within your `plugins` folder with the name you want to give your plugin (Such as `myPlugin`). Within that folder create an `events` folder, and within that you can place the Javascript definition of your events. See the [GB Studio source](https://github.com/chrismaltby/gb-studio/tree/develop/src/lib/events) for examples of how these files should be structured and how they generate [GBVM](/docs/scripting/gbvm) output. Note your event plugin Javascript filename MUST begin with `event` e.g. `eventMyFirstEvent.js`.

## Engine Plugins

An engine plugin allows similar functionality to [ejecting your engine](/docs/extending-gbstudio/engine-eject) but allows just changing single files or you can use it to add completely new files to the engine. 

Engine plugins contain an `engine` folder which follows the same structure as an ejected game engine. Below you can download an example plugin that adds a new game engine function that causes the screen to flash (only when Color mode is disabled) and also includes a script event plugin to allow calling the new function.

:::info
Your engine plugin needs to specify which version of the GB Studio engine is supported, you can do this by making sure you include `engine/engine.json` in your plugin with at least the supported engine version included `{"version": "4.0.0-e0"}`

### Engine Fields

Engine plugins can define additional fields that will appear in your [Engine Settings](/docs/settings/#engine-settings).

By defining the following field, and adding the variable `max_jump_height` to your version of `platform.c` in the plugin you can expose variables for updating from settings or scripts using [Engine Field](/docs/scripting/script-glossary/engine-fields) events.

```
{
  "version": "4.0.0-e0",
  "fields": [
    {
      "key": "max_jump_height",
      "label": "Max Jump Height",
      "group": "GAMETYPE_PLATFORMER",
      "type": "slider",
      "cType": "WORD",
      "defaultValue": 16,
      "min": 0,
      "max": 64
    }
  ]
}
```

To see how engine fields can be used within your plugin you can review the inbuilt [engine.json](https://github.com/chrismaltby/gb-studio/blob/develop/appData/src/gb/engine.json) file.

### Additional Scene Types

Engine plugins can also define additional scene types which will appear in the [type dropdown](/docs/project-editor/scenes#scene-properties) when editing scenes.

```
{
  "version": "4.0.0-e0",
  "sceneTypes": [
    {
      "key": "battle",
      "label": "Battle"
    }
  ]
}
```

When adding additional scene types you will also need to define two functions in your custom engine:
```
void SCENEKEY_init(void) BANKED { }
```
and
```
void SCENEKEY_update(void) BANKED { }
```
In this case those functions would be named `battle_init` and `battle_update`.

The `init` function will be called once as the scene is loaded and the `update` function will be called every frame allowing you to create custom game modes.
